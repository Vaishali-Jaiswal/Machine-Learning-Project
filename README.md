# Coronary Artery Disease Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning
<br>

## Project Description:
This project is based on a research paper published recently to get the Machine Learning Model with highest accuracy rate to predict Coronary Artery Diesease.
<br />

## Problem Statement: 
Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the major cause of morbidity and mortality. According to World Health Organization, 
coronary artery disease (CAD) taking 17.9 million lives each year an estimated 31% of all deaths 
globally.
<br />

## Objective: 
The objective of this project is to develop computational algorithm that can accurately detect 
coronary artery related diseases and to reduce the amount of expensive pathological tests done in 
order to diagnose whether patient has a CAD or not.
<br>

## Conclusion: 
The six ML models performed well, with accuracies found to be greater than 70.9 % and 
among all of them **Random Forest and Decision Tree found with highest accuracy of 
93.55 %**.
